# Go code generators for the Apple Device Management schema data

Package `admgen` and its related commands generate Go code from the [Apple Device Management schema data](https://github.com/apple/device-management).

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/jessepeterson/admgen.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/jessepeterson/admgen)


## Example

For example assuming you had the Apple repository checked out in `./device-management` of this repo, you could:

```sh
$ go run ./cmd/admgencmd/... ./device-management/mdm/commands/information.device.yaml | head
// Code generated by "admgencmd"; DO NOT EDIT.
// Source: information.device.yaml
package main

import "time"

// GenericCommandPayload is the "inner" generic payload for Apple MDM commands.
type GenericCommandPayload struct {
	RequestType                  string // must be set to MDM command name
	RequestRequiresNetworkTether *bool  `plist:",omitempty"`
```
